# Lecture 11 - IoT & Ethics

### IoT is notoriously insecure.

- Give people physical objects they forget to update and patch them

### IoT needs data, it functions through data.

- IoT’s advantages and problems come from data
- You leave breadcrumbs of data
    - What sort of stories can your sensor data tell about you?
    - From a ethical view point of view these are important questions:
        - Are these the stories you want told? To whom? Under what conditions? For what purpose? With what outcomes?

### “This has to be the cats”

- Demonstrates what is needed to make sense of sensor data in a home (and how difficult it would be to interpret sensor data without very specific knowledge)
- Shows what happens when data make visible what hasn’t been visible before
- Facebook takes my data, No it is collaboration between you and Facebook, by you participate and fakebook's infrastructure, you create the data.

### All data are socially constructed (no exceptions)

- How we conceive of data, how we measure them, what we do with them actively frames the nature of data
- Data arise out of particular contexts, framed and shaped by the conditions of their production.
- All data are both a representation and a sample, shaped by:
    - The field of view/sampling frame (how often, what, where?)
    - Methods of generation (what surveys, sensors, observations, interviews?)
    - The data ontology employed (how data are classified)

### Privacy in the digital world

Most discussions about privacy and personal data today rely
on two assumptions:

- we should like to have control over data about us (whatever these might be)
- it is possible to have personal control over data about us

### Privacy and data

- YOU must take responsibility for your data and prevent this from happening!
- This is an impossible demand and an underhanded shift of responsibility onto the individual
    - The focus on giving the individual control shifts attention from the responsibilities of actors that enable data creation and benefit from its use

### Privacy

- Any exchange of data is a relational act:
- An intricate negotiation of obligations and responsibilities given disclosures and knowledge
- Maybe it’s a different question we need to ask:
- What are the obligations and responsibilities implied in each data transaction?
- What SHOULD these be?

### Are we talking about ethics?

- Those who develop -& implement technologies take on increasing responsibility for the future of our societies
- Such responsibility is ethical and moral as much as it is technical.
- Ethics concern the frameworks and principles that structure our ability to live in accordance with our values and to act according to our rights, obligations and responsibilities.
- Ethics is not a framework that can be bolted on to the end of a process, nor a set of outcomes against which our actions should be measured, but a process itself.

### What is ethics in IoT?

- What are the benefits of getting it right?
- For whom? (It can never be for everybody)
- Ethics is about negotiating tradeoffs in an informed way
- Ethical frameworks support informed moral reasoning

### Ethics in practice

- You can’t buy ethics offsets for the terrible things you do at your job
- Ethics takes time, you have to think broader than just trying to get something to work
