# Lecture 1 - Architectural Analysis
## Architectural Design
>* Define the structure of the system
>* Maintain intellectual control over the design of large software systems

It involves:
* Stakeholders
* Developement by large tams
* Multiples goals
* Over long period of time

### Discussion about the system functionality
> Functionality: 
> * Functional aspect.
> * Decribes *What*
> 
> System qualities (Non functional aspect, this is not a good term)
> * Describes *How*

### Design approaches
> **Architectural concerns**: 
> System requirements mandated design decisions. 
> Those interests which pertain to the system’s development, its operation or any other aspects that are critical or otherwise important to one or more stakeholders. Concerns include system considerations such as performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability.
> **Context**: 
> System domain.
> A system’s environment or context, determines the setting and circumstances of developmental, operational, political, and
other influences upon that system.
