### Week 2

* Used analytical modelling (pen & paper)
* In the graphs add an expected curve/line
* It would be nice in project 2, to have seen how many instructions the c# code execute, compared to c++ and rust.
* Different distirbutions of data (for sorting)
* We ran project in the begining, then figured out that higher levels better suited our test
* Is reporting only the mean in both our projects a problem?
  * Should have potentially have made graphs/tables with the variability of data
* Describe whether the datasets fit in memory or not, is it uniform or not (what assumptions have we made)
* Do we include the units of our axis
